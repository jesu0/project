   <h1>TEMPERATURE CONTROLLER</h1>
   <p>Temperature controllers are measurement devices used for temperature control. Dividing into thermocouple-type and resistor-type, the electronic temperature controllers obtain the temperature change from the sensor and send the measured data to the electronic processor. The output device will then control the temperature variation within a specific range.

Delta's DT series temperature controller has fast output response, accurate PID parameter auto-tuning, supports the Modbus communication protocol and is built-in with various output types, allowing different systems to reach a stable control status very quickly. In addition, all series comply with international installation dimensions as well as CE and UL international safety approvals.</p>

   <h1>ROTARY OPTICAL ENCODER</h1>
   <p>Rotary Optical Encoder is a sensor that converts machinery positional information into corresponding pulse numbers or digital data by photoelectric signals. Therefore, it can detect the speed, position, angular velocity, distance and counts information relating to mechanical machine. It is usually applied on the angle-measuring device and equipment. Hence, it is a very important device in industrial automation field.

Delta ROE series provides precise positioning and speed sensor function. Major applications include main hoist of crane (crane control), CNC tooling machine, elevator, conveyer, textile machine, and storage equipment, etc. industry related machine. Also, it can also be built inside of many kinds of servo motors, brushless DC motor (BLDC) and induction servo motors, and converts rotary motion or position to electronic pulse numbers for phase change, speed and position detection.
